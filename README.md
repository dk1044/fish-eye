Welcome to Fish Eye, my most innovitative (cheapest) fish watching technology to date (I haven't made any others). The goal of this project is to help me practice using react, Next.js, machine learning and some messing around with hardware, and what better way to that then checking up on my fish! To make sure they haven't been eaten by the resident heron...

Goals:
-Use a ESP camera to set up a live stream of my fish pond, running it through the house server.
-Set up a website that explains the project, and can display the fish livestream
-Add machine learning to identify the fish types in the pond (its probably a Koi)

Completed:
